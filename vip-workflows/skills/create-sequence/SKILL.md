# Author a VIP Workflows Sequence Without the UI

A workflow is a **sequence**: a JSON config of stages, transitions, required tools, role permissions, transition inputs (assignments), and metadata fields. You can author one entirely without the graph editor. The reliable path is a loop:

**introspect -> draft -> validate -> create -> activate.**

## 1. Introspect

- `GET /wp-json/vip-workflows/v1/sequences/options` -> the post types a sequence may attach to, and the phase-transition graph.
- The `vip-workflows/get-sequences` ability -> the shape of sequences that already exist, to copy.
- The `vip-workflows/create-sequence` and `vip-workflows/validate-sequence` ability input schemas describe every field; read them before drafting.

## 2. Draft from the canonical template

Start from `includes/sequences/templates/editorial-basic.json` (a valid, dependency-free Draft -> Review -> Published starter) and adapt it. For an agent-driven stage, copy the pattern in `tests/fixtures/ai-copy-desk-workflow.json`.

## 3. The region model (the part that trips people up)

Every stage declares a **core status region** in its `status` field: one of `draft`, `pending`, `private`, `publish`. This is *not* the same as the workflow stage — the stage lives in post meta, the region is where WordPress keeps the post's publish status while it sits at that stage. An absent `status` defaults to `draft`; a value outside the four is **rejected**.

Each **region you use** needs exactly **one** `region_entry: true` stage — the checkpoint where a core-driven status change (the Publish button, a scheduled publish) re-seats the post. If a region names none, the first stage in that region (config order) is auto-marked. Declaring more than one `region_entry` in the same region is rejected. `region_entry` is not a constraint on transition targets — any transition may target any defined stage.

## 4. FLAT vs WRAPPED shapes

There are two on-the-wire shapes. Use the right one for the channel:

- **FLAT** — top-level `name` + `statuses` (plus `post_types`, `settings`, `metadata_fields`). Used by `POST /wp-json/vip-workflows/v1/sequences` and the `vip-workflows/create-sequence` ability. See `docs/examples/editorial-review.flat.json`.
- **WRAPPED** — `{ "type", "name", "description", "config": { "statuses", ... } }`. Used by `POST /sequences/import` and the `vip-workflows/import-sequence` ability, and it is the shape `GET /sequences/{id}/export` emits. See `docs/examples/editorial-review.wrapped.json`.

The `statuses`/`post_types`/`settings`/`metadata_fields` payload is identical in both; only the envelope differs. Feeding a WRAPPED body to create (or a FLAT body to import) fails.

## 5. Field reference (quick)

- **Stage**: `key` (unique, `sanitize_key`), `label`, `status` (region, above), `region_entry` (bool), optional `is_terminal` / `is_initial`, `transitions[]`.
- **Transition**: `to` (must be a defined stage — no dangling targets), `label`, optional `required_tools[]` (ability IDs, e.g. `vip-workflows/readability`), `allowed_roles[]` (role slugs that may make the move), `inputs[]`.
- **Transition input / assignment**: at most one `{ "type": "assignment", "meta_key", "assignee_type", "label" }` per transition; `meta_key` must be unique across the whole sequence. Import regenerates these keys.
- **Metadata field**: `key` (`^[a-z0-9_]+$`), `label`, `type` (one of `text`, `textarea`, `select`, `date`, `user`), `required`, `searchable`; a `select` needs a non-empty `options[]`. A `required` field is enforced only on transitions that cross into the `publish` region.
- **Agent stage**: `agent: { "ability_id" (registered + stage-eligible), "settings": {}, "routing": { "pass", "fail", "error" } }`; each routing target must be a `to` of that stage's own transitions.

## 6. Validate before you write

Call `vip-workflows/validate-sequence` (read-only, idempotent) with your proposed `config` (or a stored `sequence_id`). It reproduces the exact write gate and reports what is wrong plus the normalized result. Fix every reported error and re-run until it returns valid.

## 7. Create, then activate

- `vip-workflows/create-sequence` (or `POST /sequences`, FLAT) creates the sequence and defaults it to **active**. Pass `status: "draft"` to stage it first.
- `vip-workflows/import-sequence` (or `POST /sequences/import`, WRAPPED) always creates a **draft** — then call `vip-workflows/activate-sequence` with `active: true` to make it live. Activation is refused if the stored config is invalid.
- `vip-workflows/update-sequence` (or `PUT /sequences/{id}`) is a **full replacement**: any field you omit is cleared. Read/validate the stored config first.

All of the create/update/import/activate abilities require `manage_options`; export and options require only `edit_posts`.

## 8. Verify

`GET /sequences/{id}` to confirm the stored config, open a post of an attached post type to see the stages, and `GET /sequences/{id}/stats` for per-stage counts.
