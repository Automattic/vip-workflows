/**
 * Safe URL - scheme allowlist for URLs that arrive in a provider payload.
 *
 * A URL in a research agent's cards, or in the story prompt an editor selects,
 * is stored and later rendered as a link or image target. The scheme is the
 * part that decides what activating that link does, so it is checked here,
 * before the value is stored, against the only two schemes such a URL has a
 * reason to carry.
 *
 * This is one of two layers. The admin screens check the scheme again when
 * they render (`src/common/safe-url.js`), against a wider list: `mailto:`,
 * `tel:` and relative URLs pass there. That guard also serves links this class
 * never sees — the ones in a discovery provider's `recommend` and `search`
 * answers, and the ones stored before this check existed.
 *
 * A source an editor adds by its URL does not come through here. That path
 * fetches the address first, and only an `http` or `https` address can be
 * fetched (`SsrfGuard`, `UrlMetaExtractor`).
 *
 * An address that WordPress itself made for a card — the file of a generated
 * image, a post in the archive — is the one kind that can be valid without a
 * scheme or a host, on a site that is set up that way. `site_http_or_null()`
 * completes it from the address of the site, and then applies the same check.
 *
 * Hand-written rather than `esc_url_raw()`, which keeps a relative URL and
 * rewrites the ones it accepts. A card's stored identity is derived from its
 * URL, so a rewritten URL would give a card that is already stored a second
 * row.

	/**
	 * Reduce an address that this site made to a web address, or to nothing.
	 *
	 * WordPress makes the address of an attachment or of a post from the site's
	 * own settings, and a site can be set up so that the address has no scheme
	 * (`//cdn.example.com/a.png`) or no host (`/wp-content/uploads/a.png`). A
	 * browser completes such an address from the page that shows it. A stored
	 * card has no page, and http_or_null() refuses an address that is not
	 * absolute, so the address is completed here first, from the address of the
	 * site: its scheme for the first form, its scheme and host for the second.
	 *
	 * Only for an address that WordPress made. In a provider's payload a
	 * relative address is a path on the provider's site, and completed from this
	 * site's address it would become a link into this site.
	 *
	 * A path with no leading slash is not completed: it is relative to a page,
	 * and there is none. A site address that is not absolute `http` or `https`
	 * completes nothing, and the value is then checked as it is.
	 *
	 * @param mixed  $value    Address from WordPress. `false` is how WordPress says there is none.
	 * @param string $site_url Address of the site, as `site_url()` or `home_url()` returns it.
	 * @return string|null The address when it is, or was made, absolute `http` or `https`; null otherwise.
